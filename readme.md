A simple sketch that connects dat.GUI with processing.js. Nothing interesting really, just something for future reference.

Specifically, this sketch draws a shape like in the picture below via a triangle strip, and one can tweak the obvious parameters using dat.GUI on the top right. Maybe useful if one needs to draw a ring section

Processing.js and dat.GUI are projects started by J Resig and Mr Doob respectively.
